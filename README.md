## Jupyter notebook:

spotify_song_prediction.ipynb - first part exports a dataset csv which are the top songs, this is to be done at regular intervals (e.g. weekly). Second part is for modelling and user interaction. Run last cell to enter user input.


## Instructions to run project: 

Open spotify_song_prediction.ipynb and run all cells to start, where you will be prompted to enter user input. To enter a new user input song, run last cell again.
